# Amazon-Q-A-Section-Teleporter  
### ⚠️As of August 10 2024, it seems that Amazon has removed the customer Q&A section altogether, and this plugin will no longer work.

With this Chrome extension, you can quickly and easily jump to the Amazon Customer Questions &amp; Answers page from the product page with a single click. Currently, the extension only works on the United States Amazon store page, but support for other countries will be coming soon. The extension has only been tested on Chrome, Brave, and Edge.

About a year ago, Amazon began to remove a button that takes you to the Q&amp;A page from the product pages of certain categories of items. At first, it was still possible to get to the Q&amp;A page by scrolling down and finding another button hidden below the reviews, but that was also removed. Within several months, the buttons had been removed from all categories of products. It was replaced by a simple search box above the Technical Details chart, which would let you search for questions, but of course, doesn't show you all of them. It also adds another step in the process, which seems like it may be causing more duplicate questions.
  
## Features  
* Quick Navigation: Instantly navigate to the Q&amp;A section of any Amazon product page.  
* User-Friendly Interface: The injected button is placed below the product title for easy access.  
* Alternative Popup Interface: If the injected button ever breaks from Amazon changing their web page, the popup has a button that can be used until the extension is updated.  
    
## Installation  
To install the extension, follow these steps:  
1. Download and extract this repository (click on the green "Code" button and then "Download ZIP") or clone this repository.  
2. Open your browser of choice and navigate to the browser extension page (for Chrome it is at 'chrome://extensions').  
3. Enable developer mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner (in Chrome or Brave. In Edge, the switch is in the side bar. I haven't used others). Three new buttons will appear in the top left corner. (in Brave or Chrome. In Edge, it will appear at the top
page.)  
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the "Amazon Q&amp;A Section Teleporter" folder from inside of the downloaded folder.  
  
Once the extension is loaded, you should see its icon in the extensions menu, and then you can pin it for easy access.  
  
## Usage  
To use the extension, follow these steps:  
1. Navigate to an Amazon product page.  
2. Look for the button injected just below the product title. Click this button to be taken directly to the Customer Q&amp;A section.  
3. Alternatively, you can click on the extension icon in the top right corner of the browser window. In the popup that appears, click the "Go!" button.
4. You will be redirected to the Customer Questions & Answers page in a new tab.

## Future Improvements  
I am already working on making the extension compatible with Amazon store pages for other countries. In the near future, I will also be adding an option to block the extension from injecting the button into the page if it is not commonly used, or is causing problems.    
## Acknowledgements  
I had to basically rewrite the whole thing, but I used [this script](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonVine/comments/14aynxt/comment/jx7pyyb/) that was posted on Reddit on which to base the logic for the scripts in the extension.  
This extension was made as the final project for the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. I would also like to thank everyone who helped to make the CS50 course, as I would never have gotten this far without it.
