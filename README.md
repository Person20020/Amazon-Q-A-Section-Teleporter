About a year ago, Amazon began to remove a button that takes you to the Q&amp;A page from the product pages of certain categories of items. At first, it was still possible to get to the Q&amp;A page by scrolling down and finding another button hidden below the reviews, but that was also removed. Within several months, the buttons had been removed from all categories of products. It was replaced by a simple search box above the Technical Details chart, which would let you search for questions, but of course, doesn't show you all of them. It also adds another step in the process, which seems like it may be causing more duplicate questions.
  
## Features  
* Quick Navigation: Instantly navigate to the Q&amp;A section of any Amazon product page.  
* User-Friendly Interface: The injected button is placed below the product title for easy access.  
* Alternative Popup Interface: If the injected button ever breaks from amazon changing their web page, the popup has a button that can be used until the extension is updated.  
    
## Installation  
To install the extension, follow these steps:  
1. Download and extract this repository (click on the green "Code" button and then "Download ZIP") or clone this repository.  
2. Open your browser of choice and navigate to the browser extension page (for Chrome it is at chrome://extensions).  
. Enable developer mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner (in Chrome or Brave. In Edge, the switch is in the side bar. I haven't used others). Three new buttons will appear in the top left corner. (in Brave or Chrome. In Edge it will appear at the top
page.)  
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the "Amazon Q&amp;A Section Teleporter" folder from inside of the downloaded folder.  

Once the extension is loaded, you should see its icon in the extensions menu and then you can pin it for easy access.
  
## Use  
To use the extension, when you are on an Amazon product page there will be a button injected just below the product title which you can click. If that doesn't work, or you prefer the other way, you can click on the extension in the bar in the top right corner of the browser window and then on the "Go!" button. You will then be sent to the Customer Questions & Answers page in a new tab.

I had to basically rewrite the whole thing, but I used this script that was posted on Reddit ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonVine/comments/14aynxt/comment/jx7pyyb/)) on which to base the logic for the scripts in the extension.
