## Instalation  
To install the extension, download and extract the repository. Then in Chrome, go to the [extensions page](chrome://extensions) and enable developer mode. Three new buttons will appear in the top left corner. Click the one that says "Load unpacked," and select the "Amazon Q&amp;A Section Teleporter" folder.  
  
## Use  
To use the extension, when you are on an Amazon product page there will be a button injected just below the product title which you can click. If that doesn't work, or you prefer the other way, you can click on the extension in the bar in top right corner of the browser window and then on the "Go!" button. You will then be sent to the Customer Questions & Answers page in a new tab.

I modified a script that was posted on reddit ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonVine/comments/14aynxt/comment/jx7pyyb/)) as a bookmarklet, and turned it into a chrome extension. I had to basically rewrite the whole thing, and just used it to base the logic on.
