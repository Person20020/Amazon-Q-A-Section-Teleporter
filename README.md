## Instalation  
To install the extension, download and extract the repository. Then in Chrome, go to the [extensions page](chrome://extensions) and enable developer mode. Three new buttons will appear in the top left corner. Click the one that says "Load unpacked," and select the "Amazon Q&amp;A Section Teleporter" folder.  
  
## Use  
To use the extension, when you are on an Amazon product page click on the extension and then on the "Go!" button. You will then be sent to the Customer Questions & Answers page in a new tab.

I modified a script that was posted on reddit ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonVine/comments/14aynxt/comment/jx7pyyb/)) as a bookmarklet, and turned it into a chrome extension.
